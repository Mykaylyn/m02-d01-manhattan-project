"I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"

There are measurable affects to the use of nuclear power and immeasurable affects.

J. Robert Oppenheimer was an American physicist known as the "Father of the Atomic Bomb".
The quote he recited was from the Bhagavad Gita. Within the context of the Hindu
text, it describes a scene where fullfilling one's duty becomes difficult due the
way it conflicts with one's beliefs.

It was his commentary after the testing of the atomic bomb which led me to read
the Bhagavad Gita for myself. He was also the one who led me to explore my own
feelings in regards to my work. As an individual who loves to create things and
test my abilities, I had never once stopped to think that perhaps one day I would
be forced to use my skills for something that will inflict harm upon others.

This level of introspection is one that I am sure is prevalent within the scientific
community. The atomic bomb was not the only weapon to be borne out of nuclear
science. Likewise, not all creations have labelled "weapon", yet they still
inflict harm upon others.
